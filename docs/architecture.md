# Architecture Overview

## 1. Relevance Scoring
Embedding-based similarity using sentence-transformers.

## 2. Hallucination Detection
NLI model classifies each sentence as supported, contradicted, or unsupported.

## 3. Latency Measurement
Simple timing-based measurement of inference latency.

## 4. Token Cost Estimation
Estimates cost based on token counts and configurable pricing.
